The story behind your website revolves around a passionate commitment to promoting a healthier lifestyle. It began with a vision to create a community-driven platform where individuals can discover and share knowledge about healthy habits. Your website serves as a beacon for those seeking guidance on nutritious recipes, effective exercise routines, and holistic wellness practices.

At its core, your website is more than just a collection of health tips; it's a movement towards a more informed and health-conscious society. It's a response to the growing need for accessible, reliable information on living a balanced life in today's fast-paced world. By combining expert advice with community experiences, our site offers a unique, engaging, and supportive environment for individuals at all stages of their health journey.

## User Experience (UX)

*   ### Five Planes of UXD
    -   #### Strategy Plane
        Through this platform, I aspire to provide support, practical advice, and a community for those striving to navigate similar paths. My goal is to create a resource that not only informs but also inspires positive lifestyle changes.

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colors used are :
            - Primary Color (#4CAF50): A vibrant shade of green, representing health and vitality.
            - Secondary Color(#2196F3): A calming shade of blue, symbolizing trust and reliability.
            - Accent Colors (#263b27): darker shades of primary color for accents for making an energetic contrast.


    -   #### Typography
        -   The 'Lato' font is used as the Headers content and the 'Roboto' font is for the body content on the website with sans-serif as a fallback font in case the font doesn't import correctly. It is a very easy-to-read font and does fit the site well, not taking away from the overall design or the image/movie elements.

  
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The site contains a large background hero image (reduced on smaller devices) to reflect calmness and relaxing spirit to the user. It contains two cover texts and an opening phrase to get the user's attention.  It should be obvious to everyone, what the site is all about.
        -   The website features a couple of additional pictures on different pages. The articles page contains mostly all the site's advice and what is the website and the contact Page contains a large background hero image to emphasize to the user the importance of this idea. All Pictures have the alt attribute to maximize accessibility.
