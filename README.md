## Testing

### General Testing

1. The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Wellbeing were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
    - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Franeem-yad.github.io%2Fproject-portfolio-1%2Findex.html)
    - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Franeem-yad.github.io%2Fproject-portfolio-1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)


3. Resolution and Scaling were tested with Google Dev tools down to the lowest width device (Galaxy Fold, 280px) to ensure the website works flawlessly on all resolutions 280px and above.

4. The Contact Us Page was tested with empty required First/Last Name and/or Email fields, entering no Email in the Email field, also with message title and with and without comments. The Form always gave the correct feedback when something was missing. When all required Information was provided, it then is posted to Code Institute's Form Dump Page.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   ####  Visitor Goals

    1. As a Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about how to be healthy.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image where a woman relaxed and enjoying the sunlight in a calming way with a captivating title "Discover a healthier you ðŸ˜ƒ", which should lead to the conclusion that is something related to health.
        2. The user can scroll down to learn more about the general site, and look up other media resources about it.

    2. As a Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed so each page can stand on its own and the visitor can freely choose to switch between each of them at any time. The Navigation points were named fittingly, so the visitor always knows what to expect on that site.
        2. The Navigation is fixed at the top and scrolls with the page. It is read- and useable at any time.
      
    3. As a Visitor, I want to see all the articles that the website provides, so that I can educate myself more on healthy habits.

        
        2. A 'Wellbeing' option is prominently displayed in the website's navigation bar. This section leads to a lot of articles divided by category.
        3. The web page will feature three sections, which are clearly labeled in each title section (recipes - exercises - wellness and lifestyle). each section will showcase a comprehensive list of all articles.
        4. Each article in the list will have a brief summary and an engaging thumbnail image to give users an idea of the content before clicking. This feature aids in helping the user find articles that are most relevant to their interests in health and wellness.
      
    4. As a Visitor, I want to be able to contact the Website, so that the website can get feedback.
        1. A 'Contact Us' option is prominently displayed in the website's navigation bar. This section leads to a simple and user-friendly contact form where visitors can submit their feedback, inquiries, or suggestions.
        2. The contact form will include fields for the visitorâ€™s name, email, message title and message. Additionally, links to the website's social media were provided in the footer for alternative ways of communication.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome,  Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers.
-   The Website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad and different Android and iOS Phones.
-   Testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

<br>

### Known Bugs

-   On Desktop Devices with a very high resolution (above 2600px wide, e.g. a full screen window on a 4k or Ultra Wide Display), the Hero Image is no longer covering 100%. The page is then capped at 2600px and centered in the middle of the window.
-   On Desktop Devices with a very low resolution (below 280px wide), the consistency of the website can no longer be upheld. These kind of devices shouldn't be supported by modern operating systems anymore and should be extremely rare.

## Credits

### Code

-   The full-screen hero image code came originally from the [Love Running Project at Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode). The same goes for the Contact Us Page code. However, none of these  remain in their original form because they have been modified and styled differently in several aspects to fit the site's needs.

### Bug issues
- Stack Overflow for helping me to figure out how to put an overlay on an image[website](https://stackoverflow.com/)

### Content

-   All content was written by the developer, but they were modified and improved with helping of ChatGPT


### Images and Media
-   The website logo was also created by [chatGpt](https://chat.openai.com).
-   All images were taken from [pexel](https://www.pexels.com/).
-   Pexel Provides high-resolution images which affect the performance so I used a converter to convert them to Webp using [convertio](https://convertio.co/webp-converter/)
-   Card design inspired from [codepen](https://codepen.io/1bbnuuu/pen/mdoOKGO).
-   After creating the logo images I converted them to favicon using [Favicon converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
 

### Readme

-   The Basic Structure of the Readme was taken from [Code Institute's Sample Readme](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME/blob/master/README.md).
