    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colors used are :
            - Primary Color (#4CAF50): A vibrant shade of green, representing health and vitality.
            - Secondary Color(#2196F3): A calming shade of blue, symbolizing trust and reliability.
            - Accent Colors (#263b27): A darker shade of green, providing depth and contrast.


    -   #### Typography
        -   The website uses 'Lato' for headers and 'Roboto' for body text, with sans-serif as a fallback. These fonts are easy to read and complement the site's design without overshadowing other elements.

  
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The site features a large background hero image in the background (optimized for smaller devices) that embodies calmness and relaxation. It includes engaging text to capture the user's attention, clearly indicating the site's purpose.
        -   The website features a couple of additional pictures on different pages. The articles page contains mostly all the site's advice and what is the website and the contact Page contains a large background hero image to emphasize to the user the importance of this idea. All Pictures have the alt attribute to maximize accessibility.
